    "Let's say you know that a given nerve terminal contains exactly 14 quanta available for release. You have read in the literature that the release probability of these quanta is low, say 0.1. To assess whether this value is reasonable, you run a simple experiment: activate the nerve and measure the number of quanta that are released. The result is 8 quanta. What is the probability that you would get this result (8 quanta) if the true probability of release really was 0.1? What about if the true release probability was much higher; say, 0.7? What about for each decile of release probability (0.1, 0.2, ... 1.0)? Which value of release probability did you determine to be the most probable, given your measurement?"

    "Not feeling convinced by your single experiment (good scientist!), you repeat it under identical conditions. This time you measure 5 quanta that were released. Your sample size has now doubled, to two measurements. You now want to take into account both measurements when you assess the likelihoods of different possible values of the underlying release probability. To do so, assume that the two measurements in this sample are independent of one another; that is, the value of each result had no bearing on the other. In this case, the total likelihood is simply the product of the likelihoods associated with each separate measurement. It is also typical to compute the logarithm of each likelihood and take their sum, which is often more convenient. What are the values of the total likelihood and total log-likelihood in this example, if we assume that the true release probability is 0.1?"

Now you want to test whether changing the temperature of the preparation affects the release probability. So you change the temperature, perform the experiment, and measure 7 quantal events for the same 14 available quanta. Compute p-hat."
